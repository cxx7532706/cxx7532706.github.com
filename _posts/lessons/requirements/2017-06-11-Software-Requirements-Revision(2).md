## Personas

#### Personas goals 
* Experience goals: How the user wants to feel
* End goals: What the user wants to do(motivations for using the system)
* Life goals: Who the user wants to be (deep drives) --won't directly affect the developement but keep in mind

#### Persona processes
1. Group interview subjects by role
2. Identify behavioural variables
3. Map interview subjects to behavioural variables
4. Identify significant behaviour patterns
5. Synthesize characteristics and define goals
6. Check for completeness and redundancy
7. Designate persona types
8. Expand the description of attributes and behaviours

#### Identify behavioural variables
* Activities: what the user does, how often
* Attitudes: what the user thinks about domain and tech
* Aptitudes: users’ education and learning ability
* Motivation: why is the user engaged in the problem
* Skills: users’ abilities related to domain and tech

#### Identify behavioural patterns
* Find clusters of subjects that happen across multiple variables
* Logical connection between variables? (Listening to music --> regularly buying music)

## Elicitation

#### Questionnaires
* Pros:   
Low cost; Remote respondents; Large pool;
* Cons:   
Biased information due to(sample of people,set of questions);   
No direct interaction with respondents;   
Hard to provide context for questions;   
Ambiguous questions leading to inaccurate.

#### Card sorting
* Useful to understand implicit classification criteria.
* One concept per card(text or picture)
* Stakeholder partitions the cards into subsets

#### Raw data process from interview
Identify themes and topics.  
E.g. Attitudes of older people towards technology

## Prototyping

#### Paper prototype
* Quick drawing
* Users test it - explain scenario
* Use them for ideation
* Use them for early user testing
* Use them for usability testing
* Low-fidelity prototype: show only; no colors, images, meaningful contents.

#### Digital prototypes
* Enable the client to interact with the system.
* Risk of clients believing that it's the final thing.
* High-fidelity prototype.

## Product backlog
* Requirements document in Scrum.
* What will be delivered
* At the beginning of a sprint items.
* Continuously evolving
* Ordered by the product owner

#### Priorities in agile
* Order in product/sprint backlog
* MoSCoW     
     &nbsp; M: Must --Essential for the success of the project    
     &nbsp; S: Should --High priority, often critical, but if absolutely necessary can be do somehow else.    
     &nbsp; C: Could --Desired but not essential, if time allows    
     &nbsp; W: Won't --Will not happen for certain release, maybe for the future.    
* Cumulative voting
* Priority = Urgency * Value
