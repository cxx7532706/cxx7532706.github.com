	    Opinionated or biased
	    Imply an answer
	    You know the answer

	<li>Do you know of existing systems that are similar to your expected solution?</li>
	<li>How does a good output of the system look like?</li>
	<li>What problems are (not) solved by the system?</li>
	<li>Can you describe the business process?</li>
	<li>Any performance constraints that will affect the system?</li>
	<li>Anybody else that I should talk to?</li>
    <li>Anything else important that we have missed?</li>
</ul>

## Requirement Analysis

#### System-as-is vs System-to-be
<ul>
	<li>System-as-is is an existing or a current state of system or profcess, is a combination of people, process, data and technology.</li>
	<li>System-to-be is the one which is developed on the basis of the analysis done on the current system which needs to be changed.</li>
</ul>

#### System Requirements vs. Software Requirements
<ul>
	<li>System > Software, system include softare AND hardware AND networking AND etc.</li>
</ul>

#### Scope and scope creep
Scope creep (requirements creep) in project management refers to changes, continuous or uncontrolled growth in a project's scope, at any point after the projecrt begins. --Prioritise!

#### RE process
<ul>
	<li>Inception: Basic understanding of the problem, identify the people who want the solution, the nature of the solution.</li>
	<li>Elicitation: What is to be accomplished, how the system fits into the needs of the business, how the system will be used on a day-to-day basis.</li>
	<li>Specification / Modelling: Refining the elicited data as requirements models.</li>
	<li>Negotiation: Scoping with client, bringing together various viewpoints, resolving conflicting requirements, prioritizing requirements.</li>
	<li>Validation: Ensure the specification is correct, unambiguous, and free of inconsistencies. Validate with stakeholder to establish baseline.</li>
	<li>Requirements management: Maintain changes in requirements thoughout the liftcycle of the system.</li>
</ul>

#### Agile inception
<ul>
	<li>Vision and goals. -Motivation of the project and main goals.</li>
	<li>Non-goal. -what's out of scope</li>
	<li>Risks. -brainstorm, prioritise and revisit.</li>
	<li>Roles/personas</li>
	<li>Activities/workflows</li>
	<li>Stories</li>
	<li>Estimations</li>
	<li>Priorities</li>
	<li>Retrospective</li>
</ul>

## Goal Model

#### Models
* Abstraction from real word.
* Represent information needed for the development.
* Support discussion between stakeholders: A picture of your mind.
* Empowering: Brings you closer to the final product.


#### Categories / goal model mapping
<ul>
	<li>Who list - roles</li>
	<li>Do list - functional goals</li>
	<li>Be list - quality goals</li>
	<li>Feel list - emotional goals and concerns/risks</li>
</ul>

#### Hierarchy of functional goals
<ul>
	<strong>Top-down</strong>
	<li>More general to more specific</li>
	<li>Answer how the super-goal it will be achieved/decomposed?</li>
	<br>
	<strong>Bottom-up</strong>
	<li>Specific to general</li>
	<li>Answer why the sub-goal is done?</li>
</ul>

#### Human emotions
<ul>
	<li>Visceral(本能的): Look & Feel, immediate impact, pre-conscious, fast, consistent</li>
	<li>Behaviour: Use and experience of a product, sub-conscious, functionality, performance and usability, consistent</li>
	<li>Reflective: Meaning of a product and its use, culture, self-image, over tiem, non-consistent</li>
</ul>

#### S.M.A.R.T. Goals
<ul>
	<li>S: specific</li>
	<li>M: measurable</li>
	<li>A: acceptable</li>
	<li>R: realistic</li>
	<li>T: time-based</li>
</ul>
