Today I am going to introduce a powerful table tool for showing the data, it's open source, it's free, and there are a lot of extensions in Github. The tool is called "Bootstrap-table".

Don't get confused because of the name, it isn't the table that in Twitter Bootstrap, it's a new tool based on Bootstrap.

The link of this tool is here [Bootstrap-table](http://bootstrap-table.wenzhixin.net.cn/), [Source Code in Github](https://github.com/wenzhixin/bootstrap-table/).

This table supports a couple of functions such as search tools, pagination, sorting, radio,checkbox. And a lot of methods, you could basically do whatever you want by writing some Javascript codes. Handy and powerful! Highly Recommended.
