The Entrance of paintball club, staff were checking booking information.

After checked-in, you will get an uniform, then choose different bullets package to buy. 500 bullets for $85, 1000 bullets for $150 and 1500 bullets (sorry forget about this price).

A guy will teach you the rules in field, how to use the gun, the safety code etc.

Suit up! Wait for staff to guide you into the field, grab your gun! Load it, then you are ready to go!

Tips: DO NOT use all your bullets at the beginning, because there are MANY MANY MANY battles during the day, you don't want to use all of them at the very beginning. Hold your gun, aim at the enemies, shot less but precise!
